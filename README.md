# GithubPR
Short Description - Fetches and displays data from the GitHub API List open PRs in the Google Repository. When a PR is selected, show the diffs for it. These are the aggregate diffs of the whole PR, not broken down by commit. They are displayed 'side-by-side' style, similar to “Split” the way Github displays diffs.
